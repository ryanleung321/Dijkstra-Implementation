# Weighted Graph Project (Dijkstra Implementation)
This is an implementation for a weighted graph containing only positive weights and using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding minimum paths. This solution was made for ECE 250 - Algorithms and Data Structures and had the fastest tested runtime out of 149 student submissions.
